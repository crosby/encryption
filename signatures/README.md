# Signatures

## Ed25519

Modern day best practices indicate that Ed25519 (Edwards25519) signatures are best for most applications. Ed25519 provides:

* 128-bit security
* 64 byte signatures
* 256-bit/32-byte keys
* Fast performance
* Universal library support (as shown in the examples)
* Broad interoperability
* Strong security

## ML-DSA (Dilithium)

ML-DSA is the NIST recommended post-quantum digital signature algorithm that can replace/augment Ed25519.
